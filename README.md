Project Setup

This section explains how to set up both the backend and frontend of the Vehicle Management System.
Backend Setup

    Clone the repository:

    First, clone the backend repository to your local machine:

git clone <https://github.com/ET-SPARK/Mini-Project-MERN>
cd Mini-Project-MERN
cd backend

Install dependencies:

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install the project dependencies:

npm install

Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@vehicle-mini-app.nchcn.mongodb.net/
"I will attache the connection string.""

    DB_URI: MongoDB connection string for the database.
    PORT: Port number to run the backend server (default is 5000).

Run the backend server:

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the server using:

    node server.js

    The backend server will be running on http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup

    Clone the repository:

    Clone the frontend repository to your local machine:

git clone <https://github.com/ET-SPARK/Mini-Project-MERN>
cd Mini-Project-MERN
cd backend

Install dependencies:

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install the project dependencies:

npm install

Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variable:

REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=<http://localhost:5000>

This specifies the backend URL for API requests. By default, it's set to <http://localhost:5000>.

Run the frontend:

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the frontend development server using:

    npm run dev

    The frontend will be running on http://localhost:5173.

Technologies Used

    Backend:
        Node.js
        Express.js
        MongoDB (via Mongoose)
        dotenv (for environment variable management)
    Frontend:
        React vite V6
        Axios (for API requests)
        React Toastify (for notifications)
